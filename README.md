Lysense

CS50 2019 Final Project

A simple, user friendly web app for keeping track of installed software and license information for systems administrators.

I made this app because keeping track of this information has proven to be a major problem in my office.
We have old computers with current software licenses hanging around the office and when someone needs the software,
but we have run out of licenses, it can be very difficult to find those installations and release the licenses.  Hopefully,
using this app can make this process a little easier.
